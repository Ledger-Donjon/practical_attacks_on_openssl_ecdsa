    "This success rate is very low but recall that the solving process depends on an assumption and we took the least integer verifying the inequality. More clearly, the theoretical result related to the Gaussian heuristic is proven for random lattices of large dimension. In practice, the success rate of the Gaussian heuistic becomes better when the difference $\\sqrt{\\frac{d}{2\\pi e}}\\text{Vol}(M)^{1/d} - \\|v\\|$ is sufficiently large. In this situation, the vector $v$ would have more chance to become a shortest vector and thus to be catched by a lattice reduction algorithm. To do that, let us consider matrices of larger dimension (almost the double size here). "

    "The solving process presented here is very introductive and does not consider all the possible tweaks, for example it is possible to change the relying problem by considering the search of a closest vector to a given one. Also, one can obtain a more efficient method by considering another starting matrix, for example by considering *centered remainders*. In this case, one may obtain the same result with a matrix of smaller dimension. One can also use another reduction algorithm as *BKZ* to obtain better results in some cases. But it is important to remenber that all the underlying mathematical problems are known to be hard thus, for all these reduction algortihms, the quality of the solutions tends to dramatically reduce with the increase of the dimension of the input matrix. Said differently, it becomes very hard to solve the same problem when only few bits (e.g. 2 or 3) of the nonces are known."
