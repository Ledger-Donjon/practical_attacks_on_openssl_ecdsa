# Notebook for introduction to the Hidden Number Problem

This project contains a notebook associated to the SSTIC 2022 publication [Practical timing and SEMA on embedded OpenSSLâ€™s ECDSA](https://www.sstic.org/2022/presentation/practical_timing_and_sema_on_embedded_openssls_ecdsa/).

It presents an introduction to the Hidden Number Problem (HNP) and its resolution by the LLL-algorithm. This algorithm is extensively used in many cryptanalytic attacks.
